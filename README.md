# Knights Travails

Given enough turns, a knight on a standard 8x8 chess board can move from any
square to any other square. The shortest path from one square to another one can
be calculated programmatically by using a graph data structure.

The aim of this exercise is to build a function that takes in the start and end
point and calculates the shortest path between the two using a graph.
